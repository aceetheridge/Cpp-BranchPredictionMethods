I have compiled all of the versions of every part of the code into one 
script,to run the script



sudo chmod +x RUNALL.sh

./RUNALL.sh



To compile individual programs is:

g++ -std=c++11 FILENAME.cpp -o OUTPUT

./OUTPUT 2 <-(This number is the saturating counter bits)


OR comment out portions of the script, recompile the scripts
and rerun the ./RUNALL.sh 



The out put should look like this:

Let me know if any of these don't compile
-I've had issues with the oneLevel.cpp program not compiling every time
- I don't know why this is. It compiles like 90% of the time for me.
